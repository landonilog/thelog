   <h1>" This is our very first project. We created this game on Scratch. The goal of the game is to use your mouse cursor to move the guy in order to hit the ball into the gray button. Once you have reached a certain amount of points, the gray button will start moving, making it harder to score points. Good luck and have fun!!!!"</h1>
